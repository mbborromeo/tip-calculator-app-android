Tip Calculator mobile app - Android Studio, Java

This is my code for my class assignment which we had to build any mobile app in Android Studio and Java.

Since this is a student assignment, my code is heavily based on our class tutorial, as well as the book Murach's Android Programming Second Edition, 2015.

Android Studio generates a framework and some template files.  The files I edited and wrote code in are:
- main/java/tipcalculatorweek5/MainActivity.java
- main/res/layout/linear_layout.xml
- main/res/values/strings.xml
